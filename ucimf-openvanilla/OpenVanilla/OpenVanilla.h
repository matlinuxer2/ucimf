	@framework OpenVanilla Framework
	@copyright OpenVanilla.org
	@abstract OpenVanilla is a collection of popular Chinese, Taiwanese,
	Japanese and symbol input methods and language tools, and there are already 
	OpenVanilla installation package for Mac OS X, Windows and Linux platform.
	
	However, in the point of view of developers, OpenVanilla is not only an
	Inpur Method software, but a cross-platform Input Method/Text Proccessing
	framework.
	
	The OpenVanilla framework composites two main parts. One is the core
	loader, while another part is the collection of modules (or so-called 
	plugins). The core loader's work is to communicate with the system Input
	Method APIs, such as the IME (Input Method Editor) architecture on Microsoft
	Windows platform, TSM (Text Service Manager) and IMK (Input Method Kit)
	architectures on Mac OS X, and so on. Another work of the core loader
	is to load the module, the modules are dynamic loadable binary files.
	
	In other words, OpenVanilla provides an abstract interface between the
	Input Method engines and the system Input Method APIs. By the implementation
	of an OpenVnailla Inpue Method module, you need not to rewrite your codes
	for varied platforms just because the system APis are varied.
	
	The core of the OpenVanilla framework is just a concept, a header file,
	or just several simple C++ classes which define the basic but flexible 
	properties that an Input Method should have, the events it should handle
	and the tools it could use.
	
	To work with your own Input Method module, just implemet the OVInputMethod 
	class by providing an unique identifier and localized name, and creating
	an Input Method context (the OVInputMethodContext class) to handle keyboard
	events. The keyEvent method is the function to proccess/translate the
	keyboard events to corresponding text to output to the current application.
	The keyboard events are defined in the OVKeyCode class.
	 
	There are two main tools that an Input Method module could use while
	proccessing the keyboard events, they are the pre-edit buffer (OVBuffer)
	and the candidate list window (OVCandidate). If your Input Method needs to
	use several keys as components to compose a character, like most Chinese
	and Japanese Input Methods and so on, you can use the pre-edit buffer to
	display the components by calling the append() method to append a component
	to current content of the buffer, and call the send() method to send the
	content of the buffer to the current application.
	
	If there are two or more results matching to the combination of the
	components, you may ask users to choose one of these results. In this case,
	you should use the candidate list window. You can decide the content of
	the window, and ask it to be shown and hidden.
	
	If your module offers extra settings which allow users to customize the
	behaviours, your can read the settings from the configuration file
	in the initialize() method in your module. The settings of your module
	is restored in the OVDictionary object which contains varied string and
	integer values. You can use the update() method to write the settings.
	
	You can also obtain the file path of your module in the initialize()
	method. That means, if your Input Method need to load extra resources
	such as a database file and so on, you can specify the path of your database
	file when the loader is calling the initialize() method of modules.
	
	The OVService class also supports some simple tools that your module
	can use, for example, if you need to make an alert sound when the users input
	wrong keys, you can call the beep() method. And if you want to show some
	messages to notify the users, just call the notify() method.
	
	The OpenVanilla Framework also has a kind of module which is called Output
	Filter. Unlike an Input Method module which handles the keyboard events,
	an Output Filter module haneles the output text of an Input Method module.
	For example, when a user typed a character in Traditional Chinese,
	he or she can use an Output Filter module to convert the character to
	Simplified Chinese. So he or she can use his or her favorite Traditional
	Chinese Input Method to type Simplified Chinese without learning any
	Simplified Chinese Input Methods.
	
	Most methods in an Ouput Filter module are the same as the methods in an
	Input Method module. The difference between an Output Filter and an Input
	Method modules is, an Output Filter has no Input Method context, and you 
	need to implement the process() method. You can obtain the source text
	to convert in this method, and just return the converted result.

	The Output Filter is a special module type of OpenVanilla, which haneles
	the output text of an Input Method module. For example, when a user typed
	a character in Traditional Chinese, he or she can use an Output Filter
	module to convert the character to Simplified Chinese. So he or she can
	use his or her favorite Traditional Chinese Input Method to type Simplified
	Chinese without learning any Simplified Chinese Input Methods.
	
	Most methods in an Ouput Filter module are the same as the methods in an
	Input Method module. The difference between an Output Filter and an Input
	Method modules is, an Output Filter has no Input Method context, and you 
	need to implement the process() method. You can obtain the source text
	to convert in this method, and just return the converted result.
	
	OVOutputFilter is a subclass of OVModule. If you want to start 
	working with your own Output Filter module, you should work with
	your own OVOutputFilter subclass.
