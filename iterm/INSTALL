* Introduction

 This package consists of sub-packages, such are 2 libraries (libiterm,
libXiterm) and 2 applications (xiterm,fbiterm).
Below depicts that each sub-package's dependency.

 - Dependency of xiterm
     +-----------+
     |  xiterm   |  X I18N terminal emulator application
     +-----------+
     | libXiterm |  X I18N terminal emulator widget(Athena widget) library
     +-----------+
     | libiterm  |  X I18N terminal emulator library
     +-----------+

 - Dependency of fbiterm
     +-----------+
     |  fbiterm  |  FrameBuffer I18N terminal emulator application
     +-----------+
     | libiterm  |  X I18N terminal emulator library
     +-----------+

 That is, xiterm depends on libXiterm, libXiterm depends on libiterm. 
And fbiterm depends on libiterm as well.

* Compile/Install libiterm

 In basis, just ./configure && make && make install.
libiterm has 2 configure options described below.
You need PLS or fribidi library to enable these options.

  --enable-pls
     enabling PLS library for BiDi layout engine[ Default enable ]

  --enable-fribidi
     enabling fribidi library for BiDi layout engine[ Default disable ]

  If you specify both library, only fribidi library is enabled.

  --with-utempter
     use libutempter to access utmp [ Default without ]

 fribidi library does bidi layout but doesn't care about shaping,
so Arabic is not rendered properly yet.

$ cd lib
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install
$ su -
# ldconfig -v

* Compile/Install libXiterm

 libXiterm has no configure option.  Simply doing ./configure && make && 
make install is fine.

$ cd unix/Xaw/lib
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install
$ su -
# ldconfig -v

* Compile/Install xiterm

 xiterm has no configure option.

$ cd unix/Xaw/src
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install

 xiterm will be installed in /usr/local/bin.
Please check unix/Xaw/README for further information.

* Compile/Install fbiterm

 libXiterm has no configure option.  Simply doing ./configure && make &&
make install is fine.

$ cd unix/fbiterm
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install

 fbiterm will be installed in /usr/local/bin.
Please check unix/fbiterm/README for further information.

* Compile/Install terminfo entry

 fbiterm, by default, sets TERM environment variable as "iterm".
So basically you need to install proper terminfo as below..

$ cd unix/terminfo
$ tic iterm.terminfo

 tic will compile and intall terminfo entry.  If you don't specify where to
install, it'll try to install default directory, which is typically 
/usr/share/terminfo.  But if you don't have write access to the directory,
it will try to install ~/.terminfo directory.
Please check unix/terminfo/README for further information.
