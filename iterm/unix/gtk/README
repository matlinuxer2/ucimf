* What's this
 This is a very early version of libgktiterm and gtkiterm: gtk version
of iterm implementation.  I do not yet implement all the features of iterm,
but it works as a minimum terminal emulator.  So you may be able to
find how to work iterm easily compared with other iterm implementations
such are libXiterm or fbiterm.

* Requirements

 - gtk+2.0 or higher

* Compile
 Not like other iterm implementations, there is no configure scripts.
So you simply type 'make'.  And there is no 'install' target in Makefile.
If you want to install src/gtkiterm(I don't think so but in case...), 
just copy src/gtkiterm as your favorite directory.

* Known bugs
 Because this is very early version, it has very limited functionality
as a terminal emulator and lots of bugs I guess ;-(
 
 The limitations are the folloing:

 - only works on UTF-8 locale
 - can not change the window size
 - no scrollbars
 - can not see history of terminal screen
 - can not copy and paste

* ChangeLog
 - Since version 0.5
	* Modified for AIX and IBM C Compiler manner
		Dan McNichol <mcnichol@austin.ibm.com>
	* Modified to self host
