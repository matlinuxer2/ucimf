* NEW FEATURES

 This time, we included very early version of 'gtkiterm': gtk implementation
of iterm.  Because of the first early release of the implementation,
you can easily understand how libiterm works and how to use libiterm to 
create own terminal emulators.  It is a limited implementation, so the
feature of gtkiterm is not fully available not like xiterm.  However, it
works complete 80x24 terminal emulator even it is only 650 lines of codes.
 Now you can use libutempter for secure utmp access.  We implemented
libutempter driver.  By libutempter, you can access utmp database without
any privilege.
