           Jiro SEKIBA <sekiba@jp.ibm.com/jir@openi18n.org>


* What is This ?
  This is a platform-independent framework for making Internationalized 
 Virtual Terminal Emulator.  Implementing platform-dependent part of this
 framework, you can easily build internationalized virtual terminal/Widget.
 You can obtain latest .tar.gz package from following URL..

   http://www-124.ibm.com/linux/projects/iterm/

 or latest codes from Subversion Repository as below..

   svn co http://svn.openi18n.org:8081/repos/iterm/trunk

 The distribution consist of 4 parts, such are

 - lib
    libiterm, the terminal emulator library.
 - unix/fbiterm
    terminal emulator for framebuffer, which uses libiterm.
 - unix/Xaw/lib
    libXiterm, the terminal emulator widget library.
 - unix/Xaw/src
    terminal emulator for X, which uses above widget and libiterm.

  Please check Documents in each directory for further information.

* Overview
  The iterm is the multi-platform capable I18N terminal emulator, based
 on the Model-View-Controller(MVC) architecture. The MVC model provide
 portabilty and consistency among terminal emulators, including
 framebuffer based Console.

  Here is the architectural diagram of iterm.

  The foundation of the I18N terminal emulator "libiterm" implements
 the "View" independent core I18N terminal emulator capability,
 including BiDi support. The libiterm includes pluggable BiDi engine
 SPI.  At this moment, Sun's opensourced PLS library(liblayout), IBM
 PLS library, and FriBiDi are supported.(At this moment, only libiterm,
 fbiterm, libXiterm and xiterm are available).

* ToDo
 - IM support
 - Gnome, KDE widget
 - Tuning ;-)

* Known Bugs
 - doesn't shape Arabic characters when compiling with libfribidi.

* Reporting bugs/Discussion

 - Bug report of iterm are mainly accepted on li18nux-utildev, on which 
   also discussion about iterm are held.  Please refer the following URL

* FAQ

 Q1. I can't erase character other than ASCII by backspace, is this a bug?
 A1. This is not a bug of terminal emulator, but a problem of shells.
     
 Q2. When I use it on UTF-8, command line folding is strange!
 A2. This is also the problem of shells.
     You can solve these problems by using I18Ned shell.
     You can get I18N patch against bash-2.05 from URL below.
 http://oss.software.ibm.com/developer/opensource/linux/patches/?patch_id=34

 Q3. When I start xiterm, following error message appears
  > Warning: locale not supported by Xlib, locale set to C
    but I have the locale in /usr/lib/locale directory, is this a bug?
 A3. Do you set your LANG like ja_JP.utf8? X locale mechanism is case 
    sensitive.  So you have to set your LANG as ja_JP.UTF-8.

 Q4. on UTF-8 locale, xiterm seems very odd.
 A4. You may need to specify fontset by -fn option.
     I recommend unifont(http://czyborra.com/unifont/) for UTF-8 locale.
  Note: iso10646 fonts XFree86 bundles contain very limited glyphs.
        You have to choose -ja- font if you want to display Japanese.
        But ascii part of the font is, what we call, double width,
        as a result, it'll be very ugly.
