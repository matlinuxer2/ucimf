        JFBTERM      ----- J Framebuffer terminal -----

  JFBTERM is a program to print several character sets, such as Japanese
Kanji, on Linux framebuffer device.  It takes advantage of peudo tty
mechanisms to hook console output in the same way as KON. It renders
font on framebuffer device instead of VGA that is used by KON.

Features

	* It uses PCF format of font file. So, you need some bitmap font used
	  in X window system.

	* It supports ISO-2022 encodings and UTF-8 encoding.
          It also supports other coding system such as SHIFT_JIS by using
          iconv(3).

 	* It hooks output by using pty and emulate terminal on framebuffer
	  device.
